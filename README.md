# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
A work day scheduler where you can add all of the things you want to accomplish in a typical day between the hours of 9:00 and 5:00 and save them. From there you can refer to it throughout the day and based on the current time items on the list will either be color coded grey for in the past, red if in the present hour, and green if they are still to come. 

## This Version
This is the first version of the work day scheduler. It is quite limiting in that it is only by the hour. In future versions I would try to have increments of 15 minutes within each hour as a lot of things don't take a full hour to do and in a busy day one does way more than 8 things.
